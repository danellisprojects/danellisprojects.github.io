### Aspiring Data Consultant

With 16 years in the tech industry, including 10 in IT support and 6 as a programmer, I am now seeking opportunities as a data analyst to leverage my extensive experience. My journey began two decades ago when I built my first PC, sparking a lifelong passion for technology.

During my journey to master the Microsoft Power Platform with Generation UK, I’ve not only fortified my expertise in Excel, SQL, and Python but also embraced the innovative learning approach offered by DataCamp’s role play simulator. This interactive platform has been instrumental in improving my data manipulation and visualisation skills. Additionally, my ability to configure IDEs and support colleagues showcases my commitment to teamwork and technical expertise, creating a dynamic and skilled team environment.

My ambition is to join a leading firm where I can provide valuable insights and advice, contributing to both immediate and strategic goals. The vision of working for large companies IT has always inspired me, symbolising innovation and growth. I am committed to continuous learning and professional development, aiming to stay at the forefront of data analytics advancements.
